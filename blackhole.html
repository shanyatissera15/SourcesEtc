        <h1>What's in a Black Hole?</h1>
      <p>08/20/2023</p>
      
      <p>By Shanya Tissera</p>

          <p>In the vastness of the universe, few things are as spectacular as black holes. Black holes are regions of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light or electromagnetic waves. Because of this absence of light, black holes are impossible to see with the human eye. Black holes are commonly considered “empty,” even though it is far from it. Simply put, a black hole is a large amount of matter packed into a small space.</p>
         <p>Black holes feature a distinct boundary called the “event horizon.” After passing this point, the black hole will suck in all matter without a chance of escape. According to “Cosmic catastrophes: exploding stars, black holes, and mapping the universe,” by J. Craig Wheeler, this boundary is called the event horizon because if an event were to occur within the border, there would be no way of knowing if it actually happened. The event horizon also affects time. If a person could get close to a black hole with a clock, it would seem to be ticking slower than usual.</p>

      <p>Similar to the event horizon, another characteristic of a black hole is its photon sphere boundary. A photon sphere is an area of space where the power of gravity causes photons to orbit. Photon spheres can only surround an extremely compact space, such as a black hole. Unlike the event horizon, however, light can escape this boundary. The photon sphere of a black hole is further away from its center than its event horizon. Any light exiting from the photon sphere must have been caused by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon, as any light traveling towards the black hole will be sucked in past its event horizon.</p>

      <p>According to general relativity, a black hole’s center might contain a gravitational singularity, defined as a situation where the force of gravity is so strong that it completely breaks spacetime. This singularity has an infinite amount of density. If someone were to fall into a black hole past the event horizon, there would be no way to stop them from reaching the center and being crushed and added to the mass of the black hole. Of course, they would be torn apart by tidal forces before even coming close to approaching the center.</p>

      <p>Some black holes, called rotating black holes, have another surrounding layer called the ergosphere. The ergosphere is located outside the event horizon of a black hole. Its name derives from the Greek word ἔργον, meaning work. Any object in the ergosphere will begin to rotate, and it would have to move faster than the speed of light to stay still. Unlike other layers of a black hole, objects can escape the ergosphere naturally. In fact, The Penrose process theorizes that the ergosphere can extract energy from a black hole, causing things to leave the ergosphere with more energy than they entered it with.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, black holes are far from the “empty spaces” they are perceived as. From the ergosphere down to its core, black holes will continue to break the rules of space as we know it until the end of the universe.</p>
