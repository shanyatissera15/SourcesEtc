        <h1>Scientists Are Creating 3D-Printed Hearts to Revolutionalize Space Travel</h1>
      <p>07/30/2023</p>
      
      <p>By Shanya Tissera</p>

          <p>3D-printed hearts may bring us one step closer to exploring the vastness of the universe. Researchers involved with a project called PULSE have created a replica of a human heart using adult stem cells. This experiment aims to see how space radiation affects human organs, allowing scientists to see whether a person can survive in certain conditions. These 3D-printed hearts can also help in the medical field and solve problems such as costly procedures and animal experimentation. </p>
         <p>A Neoscope article written in 2019 by Dan Robitzski stated that while scientists have tried to replicate human organs many times, “organs with complex internal structures, like hearts and lungs, tend to collapse under their own weight.” Similarly, an article written by Emma Woollacott for BBC stated that “When [organs are] produced on Earth, gravity-driven forces such as convection cause crystals to form in the fibers, damaging signal quality and making it impractical for long-distance use.” If gravity affects the production of these organs, why not manufacture them in space? </p>

      <p>Several organizations have been working on this theory. A video hosted on Space.com displayed the first 3D-printed human heart in space. The caption reads, “For the first time, cardiac and vascular structures were 3D printed in a microgravity environment using adult human stem cells. Three companies led by NASA contractor Techshot Inc. developed a ‘space hardened 3D bioprinter’ prototype to accomplish the feat aboard a Zero-G parabolic flight.” The PULSE project uses both magnetic and acoustic levitation to assist in recreating human organs. Magnetic levitation involves manipulating magnetic fields to “control the movement and position of biological material.” On the other hand, Acoustic levitation uses sound waves to move materials without human interference. PULSE expresses the importance of this combination as it allows scientists to control the positioning of materials without physically touching them.</p>

      <p>These amazing 3D-printed hearts will help explore the universe and are expected to be sent to the International Space Station in 2027. However, space exploration is only one of their uses. Lorenzo Moroni, project coordinator and Professor of Biofabrication for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Maastricht, remarked, "The ambitious goals of the PULSE project are as much related to space research as they are to healthcare on Earth. Bioprinted organoids that closely replicate the complexity of human organs have the potential to reduce the reliance on animal experimentation and provide a more accurate and efficient platform to study disease mechanisms and evaluate drug responses.” In simpler terms, 3D-printed organs also benefit the medical field, especially in testing and experimentation.</p>

      <p>Richard Boling, vice president of Techshot, said, “An organ manufactured in space from the patient's own stem cells will not require anti-rejection drugs. Therefore, the overall lifetime cost for a single transplant is expected to be lower for the patient receiving an organ manufactured in space than the alternative.” This statement suggests that organs manufactured in space would save patients money, as they would theoretically cost less than using genuine human organs. However, space travel is costly, so artificial organs would have to be mass-produced for this to be true.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, 3D-printed hearts are a significant advancement in space travel and medical experimentation. The PULSE project can potentially progress deep-space travel and maybe even put someone on Mars. While there may be a long time from now to then, 3D-printed hearts are a significant milestone in making these dreams a reality.</p>
